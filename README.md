# 2024 Ad Blockers (Update Information)

<br>

<br>

Free web browser extension typically function by keeping a large blacklist of IP addresses associated with advertising. In modern online advertising, ads are retrieval from third-party sources in real-time as a site loads. There are numerous ad blockers out there, but we have only chosen those that have truly exceptional features. So, I recommend using Ad Blockers and Browser Extensions to safeguard privacy. By using the extension to block ads on websites, you can concentrate on the content that is important to you. uBlock Origin is not compatible with Manifest v3, so it may soon be removed from the extension store in the near future. However, you can find alternative extensions if you look for them. I've found an ad blocker with a strong blocking rate, so I'm going to pick out my favorite add-ons.
